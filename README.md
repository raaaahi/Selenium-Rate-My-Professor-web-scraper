# Selenium-Rate-My-Proffessor-web-scraper
Given a list of professors, the python program generates a sorted list of the proffesors and their RateMyProfessor quality scores. Program intended to help narrow down class selection for "higher quality" elective classes.

modify or create a .csv titled "rmp list.csv" where the first column has the full name of the list of professors. Often times, college/university websites can show you a list of available classes you can take. 
Run main.py, program will run in the foreground while generating the list. 
Result will be both a sorted CSV list based on ratemyprofessors.com quality score and as a text file.
